# node_editor_view_image_node
A Blender addon to quickly view images from image nodes in Blender's image viewer.

Note: Apparently, if you double-click an image node, it will open in an open Image Editor/UV Editor.  
This addon can still be useful, if double clicking doesn't work or if you would like to automatically open an image editor if one isn't open.

## Support

## Installing
1. Download this addon as a zip
2. Inside Blender Preferences > Addons, click Install from File
3. Select the zip you downloaded, and install

## Using
Right click image node in node editor > View Image Node

The image will show up in the UV Editor or Image Editor on your screen.
